# Expanding an Idea

When you start with an idea, you'll want to expand on it to create a cohesive story. This involves:

* Brainstorming: Jot down all the ideas, themes, characters, and plot points that come to mind. This is a free-flowing process to get everything out of your head and onto paper.
* Research: Gather information, read, and learn about the topics related to your story. This helps you add depth and authenticity to your narrative.
* Character development: Create character profiles, including backstories, motivations, and goals. This will help you understand how they'll interact with each other and drive the plot forward.
* Plot development: Determine the main conflict, stakes, and the character's journey. You can use tools like the Three-Act Structure or the Hero's Journey to help shape your narrative.

# Outlining a Story

Once you have a solid idea, it's time to create an outline. This will help you organize your story and ensure it flows logically. There are several outlining methods, but we'll focus on the most common ones:

* Three-Act Structure: Divide your story into three acts:
    * Act 1: Setup and inciting incident
    * Act 2: Confrontation and rising action
    * Act 3: Resolution and climax
* Story Beat Sheet: Break down your story into 15-20 key events or beats. These beats should include:
    * Inciting incident
    * Plot points (turning points that change the story's direction)
    * Character arcs ( moments of growth or change)
    * Climax
    * Resolution
* Scene List: Create a list of individual scenes that will make up your story. This can be a simple list or a more detailed outline with scene descriptions.

# Beats, Scenes, Chapters, and Acts

Now, let's explore the relationship between beats, scenes, chapters, and acts:

* Acts: Acts are the largest structural units of your story. They represent the main divisions of your narrative, typically consisting of a setup, confrontation, and resolution. Acts are made up of multiple story beats, scenes, and chapters.
* Chapters: Chapters are a way to divide your story into manageable sections for the reader. They can contain one or multiple scenes, and often end on a cliffhanger or a moment of tension to keep the reader engaged.
* Story Beats: These are the key events that drive the plot forward. They're often turning points or moments of significant change. Story beats can span multiple scenes or chapters.
* Scenes: A scene is a self-contained unit of storytelling that takes place in a single location and time. Scenes can contain multiple scene beats.
* Scene Beats: These are the individual moments within a scene that create tension, conflict, or emotional resonance. Scene beats are the building blocks of a scene.

In a typical novel, you might have:

* 3-7 acts (see `Common Story Structures` below)
* 3-5 story beats per act
* 5-10 scene beats per scene
* 1-5 scenes per chapter

# Modifications

1. Non-linear storytelling: Break the linear progression of the 7-Point Structure by using non-linear storytelling techniques, such as:
    * Flashbacks or flash-forwards
    * Unreliable narrators
    * Time jumps or time loops
    * Interweaving multiple storylines

2. Multiple protagonists: Introduce multiple protagonists with their own 7-Point Structures, which intersect or collide in interesting ways. This can create complex, layered storytelling.

3. Reversing expectations: Subvert the audience's expectations by:
    * Making the protagonist's goal not what it seems
    * Introducing a twist that changes the story's direction
    * Using an unreliable narrator to mislead the audience
    * Playing with the stakes: Raise or lower the stakes in unexpected ways, such as:
    * Making the protagonist's goal more personal or emotional
    * Introducing a higher-level threat or consequence

4. Using a "MacGuffin" that's not what it seems

5. Inverting the hero's journey: Create a story where the protagonist:
    * Fails to achieve their goal
    * Becomes a villain or anti-hero
    * Embarks on a journey of self-discovery, but with a twist (e.g., discovering a dark secret)

7. Blending genres: Combine different genres or styles to create a unique narrative, such as:
    * Science fiction and fantasy
    * Horror and comedy
    * Historical drama and romance

8. Experimenting with pacing: Play with the pacing of your story by:
    * Using slow-burning tension or rapid-fire action
    * Introducing unexpected twists or revelations
    * Creating a sense of urgency or time pressure

9. Using meta-storytelling: Self-aware storytelling that comments on the nature of storytelling itself, such as:
    * Breaking the fourth wall
    * Using narrative devices that acknowledge the audience
    * Creating a story within a story

10. Subverting tropes: Identify common tropes or clich√©s in your genre and subvert them in creative ways, such as:
    * Flipping the script on a familiar character archetype
    * Using a familiar plot device in an unexpected way
    * Creating a story that comments on or satirizes common tropes

# Oscillating Narratives

This narrative technique involves the story moving back and forth between two different perspectives, time periods, locations, or storylines. It's a form of non-linear storytelling that creates a dynamic and often complex narrative structure.

Here are some key details about oscillating narratives:

* Structure: The narrative typically alternates between two distinct elements in a regular pattern. This could be chapter by chapter, or in shorter segments within chapters.
* Purpose: This technique is often used to create contrast, build suspense, or provide multiple perspectives on events or themes.
* Types of oscillation:
    * Time: Alternating between past and present (or different time periods)
    * Perspective: Switching between different characters' points of view
    * Location: Moving between different settings or places
    * Plot lines: Alternating between two or more parallel storylines
* Tension and Resolution: The oscillation often builds tension by leaving one storyline at a crucial moment and switching to the other. Resolution typically comes when the two narratives converge or inform each other in a meaningful way.
* Themes: This structure can be particularly effective for exploring dualities, contrasts, or complementary ideas.

Examples in literature:

* "Cloud Atlas" by David Mitchell (oscillates between six different time periods and storylines)
* "The God of Small Things" by Arundhati Roy (alternates between past and present)
* "The Night Circus" by Erin Morgenstern (switches between two main storylines and time periods)

This structure can be complex and potentially confusing for readers if not handled skillfully. It requires careful pacing and clear transitions. When done well, oscillating narratives can create a rich, multifaceted story that engages readers on multiple levels and allows for complex exploration of themes and characters.

Some narratives may oscillate between more than two poles, creating a more complex structure, though this is less common due to the potential for confusion.

# MacGuffin

A MacGuffin is a plot device that motivates the characters and advances the story, but is ultimately unimportant or inconsequential to the overall narrative. The term was coined by the British screenwriter Angus MacPhail and popularized by Alfred Hitchcock.

A MacGuffin is typically an object, goal, or piece of information that:

1. Drives the plot: The MacGuffin sets the story in motion and creates tension, conflict, or suspense.
2. Is coveted by multiple parties: The MacGuffin is often desired by multiple characters, which creates conflict and drives the plot forward.
3. Has little inherent value: The MacGuffin itself is often unimportant or lacks inherent value, but its significance is exaggerated by the characters.
4. Can be replaced or substituted: The MacGuffin can be replaced or substituted with another object or goal without significantly affecting the story.

Examples of MacGuffins include:

* The briefcase in Pulp Fiction (1994)
* The Rosebud sled in Citizen Kane (1941)
* The Holy Grail in Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade (1989)
* The Death Star plans in Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope (1977)

MacGuffins serve several purposes:

1. Plot catalyst: MacGuffins get the story started and create momentum.
2. Character motivation: MacGuffins provide a clear goal for the characters, driving their actions and decisions.
3. Plot twists and turns: MacGuffins can be used to create unexpected twists and turns, keeping the audience engaged.
4. Thematic resonance: MacGuffins can symbolize themes or ideas, adding depth to the narrative.

When using a MacGuffin, remember that its significance should be exaggerated by the characters, but its actual importance should be minimal. This allows the story to focus on the characters' journeys, relationships, and themes, rather than the MacGuffin itself.

# World Building Approaches

## "Historical Analog" Approach

This method involves taking a historical event or period and transposing it to a new context. For example, a world where the Roman Empire has been recreated in a science fiction setting, or a planet where the American Wild West has been reimagined with advanced technologies.

* The Foundation (series, 1951): A series of novels that features a galactic empire inspired by the Roman Empire, with a similar structure and bureaucracy.
* Firefly (2002) by Joss Whedon: A TV series that features a future where the American Wild West has been reimagined in a science fiction setting, with cowboys and outlaws living on the edge of the solar system.

## The "Timeline Bend"

Imagine timelines that are similar to our own but have had a significant difference somewhere along their paths. For example, Electricity and magnetism were discovered before gunpowder so there are lasers and flying cars but no combustion engines.

### The "No Industrial Revolution" Timelines

* The Guns of the South (1992) by Harry Turtledove: A novel that explores a world where the Confederacy won the American Civil War and the Industrial Revolution never occurred.
* The Difference Engine (1990) by William Gibson and Bruce Sterling: A novel that explores a world where Charles Babbage's proposed mechanical computer, the Difference Engine, was actually built and led to a Victorian-era Britain with advanced computer technology.
* The Baroque Cycle (series, 2003) by Neal Stephenson: A series of novels that explores a world where the scientific revolution of the 17th century led to a complex, global network of scientists and spies, but the Industrial Revolution never occurred.

### The "Ancient Civilization Survived" Timelines

* The Shannara Series (1977) by Terry Brooks: A series of novels that explores a world where magic and technology coexist, and ancient civilizations like the Elves and Dwarves have survived to the present day.

### The "Historical Event Went Differently" Timelines

* The Plot Against America (2004) by Philip Roth: A novel that explores a world where Charles Lindbergh became President of the United States in 1940, and the country became increasingly fascist and isolationist.
* The Man in the High Castle (1962) by Philip K. Dick: A novel that explores a world where the Axis powers won World War II, and the United States is divided between the Greater Nazi Reich and the Japanese Pacific States.
* The Yiddish Policemen's Union (2007) by Michael Chabon: A novel that explores a world where Israel was destroyed in 1948, and Jewish refugees settled in Alaska, creating a unique cultural and linguistic identity.

## The "What If" Scenario

This approach involves asking a question like "What if gravity worked differently?" or "What if magic was real?" and then building a world around the consequences of that scenario. This method can lead to fascinating and unique worlds with their own rules and logics.

* Inception (2010): What if dreams could be shared and manipulated?
* The Matrix (1999): What if reality was a simulated world created by machines?
* Interstellar (2014): What if wormholes could be used for faster-than-light travel?

## The "Ecological Divergence" Method

This approach involves taking a real-world ecosystem and altering one or more key factors, such as the dominant species, climate, or geography. This can lead to the creation of strange and wondrous environments, like a world where giant fungi have replaced trees or a planet where the oceans are filled with sentient, luminescent creatures.

* Avatar (2009): A world where giant, sentient trees and a network of energy-filled vines have created a unique ecosystem.
* The Dark Crystal (1982): A world where a cataclysmic event has led to the evolution of strange, fantastical creatures.
* Dune (1965): A desert planet where giant sandworms and a rare, valuable resource called spice have shaped the ecosystem.

## The "Cultural Mashup" Technique

This approach involves combining two or more cultures, mythologies, or historical periods to create a unique blend. For example, a world that combines ancient Greek mythology with African culture or a society that blends medieval European feudalism with Japanese samurai traditions.

* Star Wars (1977): A space opera that combines elements of Westerns, samurai films, and mythology.
* The Fifth Element (1997): A sci-fi film that combines elements of ancient Egyptian and Greek mythology with futuristic technology.
* Cowboy Bebop (1998): An anime series that combines elements of jazz, Westerns, and science fiction.

## The "Planet-Scale Engineering" Approach

This method involves designing a world where a single, massive engineering project has reshaped the planet. Examples might include a world where a giant, planet-spanning wall has been built to keep out a deadly environment, or a planet where a massive, generation-spanning terraforming project has created a habitable environment.

* Ringworld (1970): A novel by Larry Niven that features a massive, ring-shaped artificial world.
* The Culture (series, 1987): A series of novels by Iain M. Banks that features a utopian, post-scarcity society that has built massive, planet-spanning megastructures.

## The "Evolutionary Divergence" Method

This approach involves taking a real-world species and altering its evolutionary path. For example, a world where humans evolved to live underwater, or a planet where a species of intelligent, tool-using insects has become the dominant intelligent species.

* District 9 (2009): A film that features an alien species that has evolved to live in a slum-like environment on Earth.
* The Last of Us (2013): A game that features a world where a mutated fungus has turned humans into zombie-like creatures.
* The Expanse (series, 2015): A series of novels and TV shows that features a world where humanity has colonized the solar system, leading to the evolution of new, environment-specific human subspecies.

## The "Philosophical Utopia/Dystopia" Approach

This method involves designing a world based on a specific philosophical or ideological concept. For example, a world where a strict, rational utilitarianism has created a society that values efficiency above all else, or a planet where a radical, anarchist ideology has led to a society with no government or authority.

* Brave New World (1932): A novel by Aldous Huxley that depicts a dystopian future where people are genetically engineered and conditioned to be happy and conform to society.
* The Handmaid's Tale (1985): A novel by Margaret Atwood that depicts a dystopian future where women have lost all their rights and are forced into reproductive servitude.
* Star Trek (1966): A franchise that depicts a utopian future where humanity has transcended many of its current problems and has formed a peaceful, interstellar government.

## The "Mythological Reimagining" Method

This approach involves taking a mythological or folklore-based world and reimagining it in a new context. For example, a world where the Norse gods are real, but have been reduced to mere mortals, or a planet where the creatures of Japanese folklore have evolved into complex, modern societies.

* The Dresden Files (series, 2000): A series of novels by Jim Butcher that features a world where magic is real and mythological creatures like vampires and werewolves exist.
* The Percy Jackson and the Olympians (series, 2005): A series of novels by Rick Riordan that features a world where Greek mythology is real and gods and monsters still exist.
* The Iron Druid Chronicles (series, 2011): A series of novels by Kevin Hearne that features a world where various mythologies are real and a 2,000-year-old druid battles supernatural creatures.
